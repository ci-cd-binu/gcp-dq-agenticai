Infusing GenAI into Data Quality in GCP Environments

*(Narrative + Technical Reference + Interview Prep Edition)*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Modern telecom and enterprise systems rely on massive, distributed data ecosystems—CRM, BSS, OSS, IoT telemetry, partner APIs, etc. While cloud data platforms like **BigQuery** and **Dataplex** have streamlined data storage, discovery, and governance, **data quality (DQ)** remains one of the most persistent pain points.

Our goal: **Infuse Generative AI (GenAI) and Agentic AI** into the data quality lifecycle to move beyond rule-based systems — enabling **contextual, adaptive, and conversational DQ intelligence**.

This document captures the **program journey**, **architectural blueprint**, **key learnings**, and **technical depth** from our implementation on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — serving as both a **reference guide** for practitioners and a **discussion-ready artifact** for GenAI architecture interviews.

## 2. Problem Statement – Why We Care About Data Quality

Every modern enterprise runs on data — CRM for customer records, BSS for billing, OSS for network operations, telemetry for real-time insights, and external feeds like APIs.

But regardless of the system maturity, **data quality issues** persist:

* **Duplicates:** The same customer appears thrice in CRM.
* **Null Values:** Billing records missing due dates.
* **Invalid Ranges:** Age of 999 in a customer profile.
* **Inconsistent Formats:** “India”, “IN”, and “Bharat” coexist.
* **Timeliness:** Orders processed before contracts were signed.

### Traditional Gaps

Most organizations rely on rule-based checks — SQL validations, ETL scripts, or DQ tools like Informatica or Collibra. These:

* Catch syntax-level errors, but not **semantic/contextual anomalies**.
* Require **manual updates** whenever schemas or business logic change.
* Operate in **batch**, leading to delayed detection.

### Business Impact

Hidden anomalies propagate into analytics, ML models, and dashboards — causing **revenue leakage**, **compliance breaches**, and **loss of trust in data**.

---

## 3. Current “As-Is” Data Quality Architecture

### Components

* **Storage:** BigQuery (warehouse), Cloud Storage (raw zone), Cloud SQL (OLTP).
* **ETL / Data Prep:** Batch scripts (SQL, Python) or commercial ETL tools.
* **Governance:** Data Catalog + Stewardship rules.
* **Reporting:** Dashboards showing failed rule counts.

### Challenges

1. Rules siloed per domain; inconsistent across teams.
2. Reactive detection, not proactive.
3. No real-time anomaly detection.
4. Every new data source = rule re-engineering effort.

---

## 4. Traditional Data Quality Rules (Baseline)

These were the 12 classic checks:

1. **Completeness** – No missing values.
2. **Uniqueness** – No duplicates.
3. **Validity** – Pattern conformance.
4. **Accuracy** – Matches reference truth.
5. **Consistency** – Same across systems.
6. **Timeliness** – Within SLA.
7. **Integrity** – Foreign key relationships valid.
8. **Conformity** – Categorical standards.
9. **Reasonableness** – Within valid range.
10. **Anomaly Detection** – Outlier thresholds.
11. **Dependency Checks** – Logical dependency (e.g., end_date > start_date).
12. **Business Rule Checks** – Domain-specific logic.

These cover **syntax**, not **semantics**. For example, “Billing date is a valid date” ≠ “Billing date precedes contract signing date”.

## 5. Why GenAI, Why Now

### Core Motivation

Traditional DQ tools detect *what’s explicitly defined*. GenAI detects *what’s contextually wrong* — using LLMs’ reasoning, pattern recognition, and adaptive capabilities.

### Key GenAI Infusion Capabilities

| Capability                       | Description                                                 | Example                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contextual Anomaly Detection** | Detects logically inconsistent but syntactically valid data | Postal code mismatch with region                     |
| **Dynamic Rule Suggestion**      | LLM proposes rules from metadata + past errors              | “Customer ID must be unique per region”              |
| **Adaptive Learning**            | Understands schema drift                                    | New billing codes or SKUs auto-learned               |
| **Conversational Stewardship**   | Human stewards query data in natural language               | “Show invalid invoices for last quarter”             |
| **Automated Remediation**        | Agent suggests or applies fixes                             | Deduplicate or correct outliers via Vertex pipelines |

### Long-term Value Proposition

Over time, LLMs learn business semantics — enabling **predictive DQ (forecasting likely anomalies)** and **prescriptive DQ (suggesting prevention strategies)**.

## 6. The Program – What We Did

## 7. Architecture Overview

### GenAI-Infused DQ Flow

1. **Data Source Layer:** Cloud Storage → Dataplex → BigQuery.
2. **Rule Engine Layer:** Baseline rule execution in BigQuery.
3. **GenAI Agent Layer:**

   * Uses **Agent Dev Kit** to register multiple agents:

     * **DQ Analyzer Agent**: Scans BigQuery tables, infers patterns.
     * **Rule Advisor Agent**: Suggests new DQ rules.
     * **Remediator Agent**: Suggests corrections.
     * **Steward Interaction Agent**: Handles natural language queries.
   * **Tool Stack:** BigQuery APIs, Dataplex DQ APIs, Vertex AI Models (Gemini 1.5 Pro).
4. **State & Memory Management:**

   * Used **Agent Orchestration Layer** (CrewAI/MCP) for agent state transitions.
   * **Shared memory** persisted in BigQuery metadata tables (conversation context, anomaly logs).
5. **Visualization Layer:** Dashboards in Looker Studio or Streamlit UI.

## 8. Sample Agent Implementation

### Example: “DQ Analyzer Agent”

**Tool Used:**

* `BigQuery Data Client` → queries metadata, sample data.
* `Vertex AI Text Model` → performs anomaly reasoning.
* `Dataplex API` → retrieves DQ metrics for reference.

**Example Prompt (System Context):**

```
You are a Data Quality Analyst.  
Given metadata, schema, and recent anomalies, identify inconsistent records  
and propose 3 validation rules that would catch them next time.
```

**Example Query to Agent:**

```
Find anomalies in customer_billing table where contract_date > invoice_date.
```

**Response (LLM Output):**

```
Detected 1,245 records violating logical sequence rule.  
Suggest rule: invoice_date >= contract_date.  
Confidence: 0.92
```

## 9. What We Observed

| Observation                                              | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Adaptive Rule Suggestion Cut Manual Effort by ~60%**   | LLM-generated rules automated many checks                                                                                     |
| **Natural Language Interface Improved Steward Adoption** | Non-technical users engaged more with data                                                                                    |
| **Challenges:**                                          | - Schema evolution caused prompt drift<br>- High token cost for large tables<br>- Needed summarization for context windows    |
| **Fixes:**                                               | - Used embedding + retrieval for context<br>- Summarized metadata by domain<br>- Cached rule suggestions in Dataplex metadata |
