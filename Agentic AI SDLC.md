| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Problem requires reasoning, generation, or summarization? | ✅              | ❌         |
| Problem involves multi-step tasks or multiple roles?      | ✅              | ❌         |
| Context or memory across sessions is needed?              | ✅              | ❌         |
| Outputs are deterministic (labels, scores)?               | ❌              | ✅         |
| Data is multi-source or multi-modal?                      | ✅              | ❌         |

## **Stage 3: Data Strategy & Preprocessing**

### **3.1 Data Requirements in Agentic AI**

Unlike classical ML, Agentic AI consumes **multi-source, multi-modal, and often unstructured data**, combined with structured datasets for reasoning:

1. **Internal Knowledge**

   * Transaction logs, CRM/ERP systems, policy records
   * Example: Vehicle order history, customer cancellation patterns

2. **External Knowledge**

   * Manuals, regulatory guidelines, product specifications
   * Example: UK telecom ETL process manuals for data quality orchestration

3. **Knowledge Representation**

   * **Vectorized embeddings** for RAG retrieval
   * Text → Sentence embeddings → FAISS / Pinecone storage

4. **Memory Requirements**

   * Short-term: session-level memory (Redis)
   * Medium-term: task-specific history (SQL / NoSQL w/ TTL)
   * Long-term: domain knowledge (Vector DB, FAISS)

---

### **3.2 Preprocessing Patterns**

* **Text Cleaning:** remove HTML, special characters, normalize cases
* **Chunking:** split long documents for embedding, 500–1,000 tokens per chunk
* **Deduplication:** remove repetitive content to reduce vector DB noise
* **Metadata Indexing:** tag documents with type, source, date, and domain
* **Embedding Generation:** use model embeddings suitable for task (OpenAI, Cohere, Bedrock)

**Project Example:**

* **RAG-Powered Insurance Policy Copilot**

  * Ingested 500K+ policy documents
  * Chunked and embedded for multi-document retrieval
  * Combined retrieval with LightGBM for personalized recommendations
  * Outcome: +15% renewal rate, 30% faster query resolution

**Lesson Learned:** Proper **embedding and metadata tagging upfront** avoids hallucinations and ensures contextually relevant reasoning.

---

## **Stage 4: Modeling & Experimentation**

### **4.1 Agent-Specific Modeling Patterns**

## **Stage 9: Differences from Classical ML/DS SDLC**

Understanding the differences between **classical ML/DS projects** and **Agentic AI / GenAI projects** is crucial for architects, engineers, and managers.

| SDLC Stage          | ML/DS                                      | Agentic AI / GenAI                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem Framing** | Predict labels or scores, optimize metrics | Decompose tasks, assign to agents, define reasoning and retrieval steps                                            |
| **Data Strategy**   | Structured, labeled datasets               | Multi-source, multi-format (structured + unstructured), embeddings for retrieval                                   |
| **Pipeline**        | ETL → Train → Inference → Feedback         | Ingestion → Embedding → Vector DB → Multi-Agent Orchestration → LLM Reasoning → Post-Processing → Feedback Logging |
| **Modeling**        | Single predictive model                    | Multiple agents (predictive + generative), memory-aware, RAG-enabled                                               |
| **Evaluation**      | Accuracy, RMSE, F1, ROC-AUC                | Quantitative + qualitative + hallucination checks + retrieval relevance                                            |
| **Deployment**      | Model API, batch scoring                   | Orchestrated microservices, memory & retrieval management, multi-agent orchestration                               |
| **Monitoring**      | Accuracy drift, model retraining           | Memory drift, hallucination detection, retrieval relevance, agent reasoning traces                                 |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Agentic AI requires memory management**: Unlike ML models that are stateless, Agentic AI needs **short/medium/long-term memory layers** for reasoning.
2. **RAG is central**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is required to ground generative outputs in real data.
3. **Modular agent pipelines**: Agents can fail independently, so **observability and error logging** are more complex.
4. **Error triage is multi-dimensional**: Prompt → Memory → Retrieval → Model. Classical ML only requires model evaluation.

**Lesson Learned:** Treat Agentic AI **more like a distributed, reasoning system than a traditional ML pipeline**.
