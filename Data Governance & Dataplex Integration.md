# Data Governance & Dataplex Integration**

### *Metadata Management, Policy Alignment & Operational Governance for Agentic AI DQ Systems*

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This document defines the **governance and metadata integration layer** for the Agentic AI–driven Data Quality (DQ) system described in Doc-2 (Implementation Deep Dive) and Doc-3 (Prompt Engineering & Fine-Tuning).
It operationalizes the **policy, lineage, and compliance foundations** of the system using **Google Cloud Dataplex**, **Data Catalog**, and **AgentSpace governance hooks**.

Specifically, this Doc explains how:

* Governance agents enforce compliance with **PII, data access, and remediation approval policies**.
* **Dataplex** serves as the **control plane for metadata, lineage, and rule versioning**.
* **Data Catalog** provides semantic grounding and context for all AI-driven DQ decisions.
* **Feedback loops** are built into the Dataplex metadata model so that **approved AI-discovered rules** can auto-promote into production policies.
* **Operational dashboards and observability** are designed to align with enterprise audit and cost monitoring frameworks.

Outcome:
The DQ platform evolves from static, script-based controls to an **adaptive, metadata-driven governance mesh**, ensuring every detection, explanation, and remediation is **traceable, policy-compliant, and auditable**.

## **4. Dataplex Integration Patterns**

### **4.1 Metadata Model Extension**

Each DQ incident and rule is represented in Dataplex as an **extended metadata entity**:

| Field              | Example                                   | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `dq_rule_id`       | `DQ_R001`                                 | Unique rule identifier         |
| `rule_text`        | `"Check null rate < 2% for billing_date"` | SQL or natural-language rule   |
| `source_dataset`   | `billing.prod_charges`                    | Dataset identifier             |
| `ai_discovered`    | `true`                                    | Indicates if generated by AI   |
| `steward_approval` | `approved_by=“data_governance_team”`      | Governance metadata            |
| `policy_ref`       | `dataplex://policy/pii_redact`            | Reference to associated policy |
| `lineage_links`    | `[source_feed, downstream_table]`         | Lineage metadata               |

These are automatically synced into Dataplex via **Dataplex Metadata APIs** from the Governance Agent.

---

### **4.2 Dataplex Policy Enforcement Workflow**

1. **Agent triggers detection** → DQ incident created.
2. **Governance Agent** reads associated Dataplex policy tags (e.g., *PII = true*, *financial = true*).
3. **Policy evaluation**:

   * If *auto-remediation allowed = false* → Steward approval required.
   * If *sensitivity level = low* → Auto-remediation permitted.
4. **Steward approval** or **Governance override** recorded as a Dataplex metadata update.
5. **Audit entry** written to BigQuery.

Example Policy YAML:

```yaml
policy_id: dq_remediation_policy
rules:
  - condition: sensitivity == "PII"
    action: require_approval
  - condition: sensitivity == "public"
    action: auto_remediate
  - condition: dataset_owner == "finance"
    action: notify_cfo
```

---

### **4.3 Dataplex Rule Lifecycle**

| Phase        | Trigger                   | Responsible Agent     | Dataplex Action               |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Discover** | Repeated incident pattern | Rule-Generator Agent  | Propose new rule metadata     |
| **Review**   | Steward validation        | Governance Agent + UI | Create draft policy           |
| **Promote**  | Approval                  | Governance Agent      | Update Dataplex rule registry |
| **Monitor**  | Execution feedback        | Orchestrator Agent    | Log metrics & lineage         |
| **Retire**   | Obsolete or failed        | Governance Agent      | Deprecate metadata entry      |

---

## **5. Data Catalog Integration**

### **5.1 Catalog Contextualization**

Each **dq_incident** is linked to:

* The **dataset entry** in Data Catalog,
* The **rule metadata** in Dataplex,
* The **lineage** of upstream and downstream dependencies.

The **Reasoner Agent** uses the Catalog API to fetch:

* Descriptions and business glossaries,
* Tag templates (e.g., domain = billing, owner = finance),
* Prior incidents on same entity (context for RAG).

### **5.2 Tag Templates Example**

```yaml
template_id: dq_metadata_tags
fields:
  dq_severity: ENUM(CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  dq_confidence: FLOAT
  steward: STRING
  ai_discovered: BOOL
  last_reviewed: TIMESTAMP
```

These tags appear in the Data Catalog UI and are queryable via SQL through BigQuery’s **INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TAG_FIELDS** view.

## **6. Governance Agent — Design Details**

### **6.1 Responsibilities**

| Area                      | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Policy enforcement**    | Checks Dataplex metadata to decide if action needs approval           |
| **DLP integration**       | Invokes Cloud DLP for PII redaction before sending sample data to LLM |
| **Audit management**      | Creates compliance logs in BigQuery                                   |
| **Steward orchestration** | Coordinates with AgentSpace for human review                          |
| **Feedback loop**         | Updates Dataplex metadata when policies are promoted                  |

### **6.2 Key API Flow**

1. `dq_incident_detected` → event → Governance Agent.
2. Governance Agent calls:

   * `GET /dataplex/v1/entities/{dataset}`
   * `GET /dataplex/v1/policies/{policy_id}`
3. Evaluates policy JSON → decision = auto / manual / reject.
4. Calls Cloud DLP if necessary → redacts sample payload.
5. Posts review task in AgentSpace (Pub/Sub event).
6. Writes audit log → BigQuery → triggers Looker dashboard refresh.

---

## **7. Operational Governance Flows**

### **7.1 Steward Approval Lifecycle**

```
[Detector Agent] 
   ↓
[Governance Agent]
   ↓
[AgentSpace UI] — steward approves/rejects
   ↓
[Feedback Agent + Dataplex Metadata Update]
   ↓
[Audit Store]
```

### **7.2 Automated Policy Promotion**

When multiple incidents of the same type receive identical steward remediations:

1. Rule-Generator Agent synthesizes a generalized rule.
2. Governance Agent validates and submits as a *draft policy* in Dataplex.
3. If approved → auto-promotion into the Dataplex policy registry.
4. Dataplex propagates rule → new DQ baseline.

This creates a **self-reinforcing governance system** — every human decision strengthens automated policy.

---

## **8. Auditing & Monitoring**

### **8.1 BigQuery Audit Schema**

| Field         | Type      | Description                            |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `event_id`    | STRING    | Unique audit event                     |
| `agent_id`    | STRING    | Orchestrator / Detector / Governance   |
| `action_type` | STRING    | detect / explain / remediate / approve |
| `steward_id`  | STRING    | Reviewer                               |
| `decision`    | STRING    | approve / reject / auto                |
| `timestamp`   | TIMESTAMP | Event time                             |
| `policy_ref`  | STRING    | Dataplex policy link                   |

### **8.2 Dashboards**

* **Steward Productivity Dashboard:** incidents reviewed, turnaround time, approval rates.
* **Policy Drift Dashboard:** difference between AI-discovered vs. approved rules.
* **Compliance Dashboard:** datasets by sensitivity class, ungoverned %.

All metrics sourced from **BigQuery audit tables + Dataplex policy inventory**.

---

## **9. Security and Compliance Controls**

* **PII Protection:** enforced via Cloud DLP classification + tokenization.
* **Least Privilege:** IAM separation for each agent role.
* **VPC-SC:** ensures LLM calls and Dataplex metadata exchange stay within GCP perimeter.
* **Key Management:** Cloud KMS for encryption of incident payloads.
* **Model Audit:** Vertex AI model cards versioned and linked in Catalog.

---

## **10. Integration with CI/CD and MLOps**

* Dataplex policy and Data Catalog templates versioned in **Cloud Source Repos**.
* Governance Agent automatically validates metadata JSON schema pre-merge.
* **Cloud Build pipelines** push approved Dataplex policies to staging and prod environments.
* Every promotion triggers a **Policy Validation Run**, generating compliance metrics.

## **12. Summary**

Doc-4 defines how **governance becomes a dynamic participant** in the Agentic AI ecosystem — not an afterthought.
Through **Dataplex + Data Catalog + Governance Agents**, enterprises achieve:

* **Adaptive metadata-driven compliance,**
* **Traceable DQ lineage,**
* **Self-evolving rule intelligence,**
* **Federated governance visibility across domains.**

This closes the loop between *autonomous AI operations* and *human policy oversight*, ensuring trust, transparency, and auditability across the data lifecycle.
