# 🧭 1️⃣ INTERVIEWER QUESTIONS (COST, TRADEOFFS & ARCHITECTURE DEPTH)

### A. General Cost Architecture Questions

1. When you designed these multi-agent systems, how did you estimate **token consumption** and budget for inference cost?
2. What methods did you use to **control cost spikes** in production due to high concurrency or long conversations?
3. Did you explore **open-weight or distilled models** to reduce cost? How did you balance performance vs accuracy?
4. How did you decide between **cloud-native vector DBs** (like Vertex Matching Engine / Bedrock KB) and **self-hosted FAISS**?
5. When multiple agents interact, how did you ensure **memory sharing** or context passing doesn’t lead to redundant token use?
6. In which scenarios did you **cache responses or embeddings**, and how did you manage staleness?
7. Did you have to **downgrade model tiers** (e.g., GPT-4 → Claude 3 Haiku) for cost efficiency?
8. How did you track **cost attribution per agent / per pipeline**?
9. Were there cases where **fine-tuning or RAG** helped avoid repeated model calls?
10. How did you decide between **retrieval-heavy** vs **generation-heavy** architectures when optimizing for cost?

# ⚙️ 2️⃣ BEST ANSWERS — “THE DELIGHT FACTOR”

### A. General Strategy Answers (to any cost tradeoff question)

> “We treated cost as a first-class metric from design stage.
> Every agent was profiled for average tokens per decision cycle, and we built a **token-to-business-value ratio**.
> Instead of optimizing purely for minimal spend, we optimized for **cost per successful outcome** — e.g., one correctly validated order cost 2.3¢ vs 5.8¢ earlier.
> We achieved this using **tiered model routing, caching, summarization, and hybrid retrieval**.”

> “We applied a **three-layer architecture**:
>
> * Lightweight local models for pre-processing or extraction (free/cheap).
> * RAG-based mid-tier retrieval for relevant knowledge.
> * High-cost LLMs only for reasoning.
>   That cut token cost 40–55% across projects.”

### B. Project-Wise Detailed Responses

#### 🔹 *Multi-Agent Vehicle Order Optimization (GCP Vertex AI)*

> “The biggest cost driver was three agents reasoning in parallel.
> We built a **shared context registry** in BigQuery that cached intermediate reasoning results.
> That avoided each agent calling PaLM separately.
> Additionally, we moved from PaLM-2-Bison to PaLM-2-Gecko for non-critical steps — cutting cost ~38%.
> We also batched customer inquiries overnight for asynchronous runs instead of synchronous calls during peak hours.”
> **Tradeoff:** Some latency increase (~400 ms), but business impact minimal.

---

#### 🔹 *Agentic Data Quality Orchestration*

> “Legacy ETL was batch-heavy and compute-intensive; our LLM-based DQ checks used lightweight semantic validation.
> However, we faced cost blow-ups when agents looped on self-healing tasks.
> We added **budget tokens** per job — if a task exceeded its allowance, it gracefully degraded to rule-based checks.
> We also used **LangGraph summarization** for anomaly logs, replacing 30 MB of text with 300 tokens.
> This cut monthly spend by 60%, without affecting detection accuracy.”

---

#### 🔹 *Agentic Architecture Office*

> “The AWS Kendra + Bedrock Knowledge Base retrieval was expensive in early runs (~$400/day).
> We reduced this by pre-computing **summary embeddings** of architecture documents and storing them in FAISS.
> Kendra was only used for rare queries needing structured metadata search.
> We also implemented **semantic caching** — 70% of ADR queries repeated, so caching saved $2–3K/month.”
> **Tradeoff:** Slight staleness in cached responses; we set TTL = 7 days.

---

#### 🔹 *Enterprise GenAI Revenue Platform*

> “Cost management was the hardest because each hyperscaler had different billing.
> We implemented a **cost-aware router** — each incoming request was routed to the most economical model tier per task (Claude 3 Haiku on Bedrock for summaries, GPT-4 for reasoning, Gemini 1.5 for code generation).
> That saved ~45% vs single-vendor design.
> We also consolidated telemetry via BigQuery Looker dashboards for cross-cloud cost attribution.
> The tradeoff was slightly higher integration overhead (~15% more maintenance effort).”

---

#### 🔹 *RAG-Powered Insurance Policy Copilot*

> “Embedding and retrieval cost grew rapidly as policy documents multiplied.
> We applied **two-tier memory**: hot embeddings in FAISS (for 20% most-accessed policies), and cold embeddings in S3.
> Retrieval latency rose by 0.5 s for cold policies, but storage cost dropped 68%.
> Additionally, we switched from GPT-4 to Bedrock’s Claude 3 Sonnet for generation — saving $0.02 per 1K tokens with negligible quality loss.”
